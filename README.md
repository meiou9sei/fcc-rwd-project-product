freeCodeCamp responsive web design course project "Product Landing Page"

This project is for freeCodeCamp's third project in responsive
web design course, to create a product landing page. I am making
it as extra to the odin project, to become more familiar with 
HTML and CSS. I also add some humour to my learning-projects
so if you want, go ahead and check it out. 

It is a solo project created entirely in HTML and CSS, and uses
flexbox so I can learn that.
